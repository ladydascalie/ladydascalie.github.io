Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I am an enthusiastic Go developer with skills ranging from large scale APIs to command line applications.

I have led teams from 10 to 30 people in size as a developer lead as well as a principal engineer.

Involved in free and open source software community, I create and maintain software, and I co-organise the Golang Dorset monthly meet-up alongside friends & colleagues.

My main workhorse is Go, which I use daily to work on both micro-services, as well as numerous command-line tools. I have extensive experience with PHP, both in creating new applications and maintaining legacy software.

In my spare time, I like engaging with educational material, writing small video games, mainly using C & SDL2, writing and recording music.
